# XOR-Problem-NN
sketch based off Coding Challenge 92: XOR Problem from the Coding Train

This is a sketch using p5.js and the Toy Neural Network from the Coding Train that trains a Neural Network to solve
the XOR problem. This is exactly what Dan Shiffman did in the YouTube video *Coding Challenge 92: XOR Problem from the Coding Train*.

This sketch allows you to tweak some of the parameters of neural network and also graphs the error (loss) of the
neural network over time. It also goes through and finds a solution for each pixel (which makes it rather slow)
of the canvas.

Here is an example of the program running. Due to the high demand on the CPU,
of this program, it is not currently being hosted anywhere.
